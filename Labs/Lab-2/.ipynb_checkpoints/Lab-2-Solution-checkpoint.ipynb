    "\n",
    "This lab aims to introduce you to basic Unix, familiarize you with Jupyter and get you setup to submit your homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for most other labs, you will work primarily in the lab notebook, like the one you are reading right now. For this lab, however, you'll need to open at least one additional tab running a terminal. For your convienence, I suggest you move the terminal tab to another browser window and arrange your windows so that you can see this notebook and the terminal simultaneously. Otherwise, you are welcome to switch back and forth between this notebook tab and the terminal tab. Be careful not to close either tab.\n"

    "## Terminal, Shell, and ssh\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't already have a tab with a terminal open, open one by returning to the jupyter file list tab and selecting new terminal from the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in this instance your terminal is running in a browser, you can also run terminals natively on your own computer. On Linux or MacOS, you just have to run a program called terminal. In Windows you can start a \"command prompt\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal is a simple program that generally runs another program, taking mostly keyboard input from you, passing it to this other program, and taking the output of the program and displaying on the screen for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal usually runs a program called a shell. Shells present a command prompt where you can type in commands, which are then executed when you press enter. In most shells, there are some special commands which the shell will execute. Everything else you type in, the shell will assume is a name of a program you want to run and arguments you want to pass that program. So if the shell doesn't recognize something you type in, it'll try to find a program with a name that is the same as the first word you gave it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type in \"ls\" into the terminal and press enter. The shell will find a program called \"ls\", a standard tool in Unix, and run it. \"ls\" lists the contents (files and directories) of your current directory. If you are just starting in this course, you probably only see the git repository you cloned. \n",
    "\n",
    "A subtle point to realize here is that while the terminal is running in the browser that is running on the computer in front of you, the shell is actually running on a machine at TACC. The shell prompt on TACC typically displays the name of the machine you are using and a counter (more on that later). What you are not seeing is that there is an intermidate program between the terminal running on your computer and the shell running on TACC. This intermidary program is taking your input from the terminal sending it over the network to TACC and bringing back the responses for you terminal to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start a terminal on your own computer, the shell runs locally. The \"ls\" command would then list contents of a directory on your computer. If you want to access a shell running on TACC, you would have to initiate this intermidiary program yourself. The program is called \"ssh\" (secure shell). You can \"ssh\" to another machine from your machine, by simply typing \"ssh\" followed by the machine name or IP address. Most likely you would be prompted for a password, after which you would dropped into the prompt of a shell running on the remote machine.\n"

    "## Programs and Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a listing of your current directory, but you don't know where that directory resides. You can see what directory you are using the command \"pwd\" (print working directory). Issue the command and look at the response. You'll get a slash (\"/\") separated list, known as the path, of the directory hierarchy of your current working directory. On TACC, this will start with \"home\", followed by a number (user ID?), and your username. This is the path of you \"home\" directory, a storage area reserved for you on TACC where you and only you can store your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to thinking about the command prompt. Since \"ls\" is a program, it most be stored somewhere. It is clearly not in your working directory, because you didn't see it when you executed \"ls\". We can ask the shell to tell us where it found \"ls\" using the \"which ls\" command. Note that \"which\" is also a program. \"which ls\" comes back with \"/bin/ls\", telling you the \"ls\" program is sitting in \"/bin\" directory of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see what else is in there by issuing a \"ls /bin\" command. You will get a long list of programs. You can run any of these programs by just typing their names and pressing enter. You may be able to guess what some of these programs do, but if you want to know, most of them provide you help, using \"--help\" or \"-h\" flag. For example execute \"ls --help\". For more information about a program or command, you can use Unix's manual pages using the \"man\" command. Try typing \"man ls\". Note that you will need to press space to scroll through lengthy manual pages and \"q\" to exit back to the shell prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another command interesting is \"echo\". \"echo\" simply prints whatever you put after it to the screen. Try executing \"echo Hello World.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may wonder how was it that the shell knew to look for programs in \"/bin\"? The shell keeps a list of places to look for programs an environment variable with the name \"PATH\". The shell keeps a table that map string variable names to string expressions. When the shell starts, its configuration files set some environment variables that it uses. You can see the full list of defined environment variables using the command \"printenv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a environment variable in a shell by prepending name of the variable with a dollar sign character (\"\\$\"). So you can print out the PATH environment variable using the command \"echo $PATH\". What you will see is a colon (\":\") separated list of directories that the shell will search (in order) whenever you type in anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set you own environment variables. Different shells have different syntax. Lets first figure out what shell we are running. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Exercise 1:* Use the \"echo\" command to print out the value of the \"SHELL\" environment variable and paste the results into the box below:"

    "## Navigating Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change your current directory using the \"cd\" shell command. Note that \"cd\" is not a Unix program. Once in a directory, you can use the \"ls\" command to list the contents or \"pwd\" to remind yourself your current working directory. You can move back one level in your current directory hierarchy using \"cd ..\". In general \"..\" represents the path to a directory one level above your current directory, \"../..\" represents two levels up, and so on. \".\" represents the current directory. If you look at the PATH environment variable, you'll notice that the last item is \".\", telling the shell to look into your current directory for commands.

    "\n",
    "As explained in lecture, Unix stores most information in text files. For example, the list of all users and their home directories are stored in \"/etc/passwd\". Let get some familiarity with the most commonly used commands to manipulate files.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - To go through the file page by page, you can use the \"less\" or \"more\" commands. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - You can see the first or last N (N=10 by default) lines of a file using \"head\" or \"tail\" commands. For example \"tail -20 /etc/passwd\" will list the last 20 lines. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - You can search a test file using the \"grep\" command, which takes a string keyword as the first argument and a filename as the second, and by default prints out every line in the file that contrains the string. So for example you can do \"grep \\$USER /etc/passwd\" to find the line corresponding to your account. Some useful flags: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - \"-i\" ignores the case of the keyword\n",
    "   - \"-v\" display those lines that do NOT match \n",
    "   - \"-n\" precede each matching line with the line number \n",
    "   - \"-c\" print only the total count of matched lines \n",
    "   \n",
    "   For example \"grep -c \\$USER /etc/passwd\" should show that you are in the password file just once. \n",
    "   \n",

    "## Redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix provides programs \"pipes\" for input and output. Most of what you see on the screen when you run a program  was written to the \"stdout\" (standard output) pipe. Other pipes are \"stdin\" (standard input) and \"stderr\" (standard error), where error messages are written.\n",

Note that from now on we will use the convention: \"control-d\" = \"^D\"\n",
